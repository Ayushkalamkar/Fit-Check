Fit-Check is a fully responsive frontend e-commerce website developed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a clean, modern UI for an online fashion store and is optimized for all screen sizes using Tailwind's utility-first responsive design system.
The application includes functional product listings, category filters, a cart system (frontend only), and dynamic user interface interactions powered by JavaScript. It demonstrates modular, reusable components and scalable layout structures built with Tailwind CSS.
JavaScript handles DOM manipulation, UI state updates (like cart toggling), and basic validation to simulate real-world e-commerce behavior. The codebase is organized for readability and maintainability, making it easy to integrate with backend APIs or expand into a full-stack project.
Ideal for frontend developers looking to showcase responsive design skills and interactive UI development without relying on frameworks.
